But I think much more people can make use of the content on this blog like this, then when I would write it in german. so if you have a problem with bad grammer, this blog is probably nothing for you, sorry  as I am not an english native speaker, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t change     Oh and I am older then the internet üë¥üèª  ",

Thats why my HomeLab Build is probably a lot different the what you are used to.\nMost of my machines have quite low specs, and several different Operating Systems, so I distribute the tasks between them. I handle most of it via SSH, it works ok like that.\nMaybe one day i will have a powerfull enough machine to handle all of the tasks at the same time ;) I might also just throw proxmox on my Gaming PC one day and handle everything like that in one place.
