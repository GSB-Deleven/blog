# Homelab Setup 2022

I have accumulated a whole lot of computers/tablets/phones/NAS/etc over the years.
Thats why my HomeLab Build is probably a lot different the what you are used to.

Most of my machines have quite low specs, and several different Operating Systems, so I distribute the tasks between them.
I handle most of it via SSH, it works ok like that.

Maybe one day i will have a powerfull enough machine to handle all of the tasks at the same time ;)
I might also just throw `proxmox` on my `Gaming PC` one day and handle everything like that in one place.
But for now it seems to work fine like it is.
