I'm Dave aka Deleven  
I am a **Dad, Husband, Dogdaddy, Geek, Nerd, Photographer, Tech enthusiast and somewhat of a weirdo**  
I think that should already tell you quite a bit about me.  

---
Here are some more facts about me:
- I'm Swiss🇨🇭
    - No, I am not made out of money
    - Yes, we do eat other things than cheese and choclate
    - No Switzerland🇨🇭 is not Sweden🇸🇪
- I have many talents, but writing and grammar aren't some of them
    - I get, that it is kind of ironic to say that and then create a blog in english. But I think much more people can make use of the content on this blog like this, then when I would write it in german.
    - so if you have a problem with bad grammer, this blog is probably nothing for you, sorry
        - as I am not an english native speaker, it probably won't change 
- Oh and I am older then the internet 👴🏻
